# State-ReduxStore

## Description
    Welcome to the E-commerce Platform project! This is a React-based web application that allows users to browse products, sign up, and proceed to checkout. It utilizes Redux for state management and includes features such as a shopping cart and user authentication. On this project I had trouble to render the application, when trying to build the application it would fail.
